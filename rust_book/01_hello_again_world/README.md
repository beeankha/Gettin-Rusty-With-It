# [Getting Started](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch01-00-getting-started.html)

> Restarting this learning journey as of August 2022!

My re-implementation of "Hello world!" in Rust, from [Chapter 1 of the Rust book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch01-02-hello-world.html).

## Running `hello_again_world.rs`

To run this simple first-time program (assuming you have Rust and everything
necessary for it already installed), clone/download/copy the `hello_again_world.rs`
file and then run:

```
$ rustc hello_again_world.rs
$ ./hello_again_world
```

## Building and running `hello_again_world` (as `src/main.rs`)

From `bianca_rust/hello_again_world/hello_again_cargo`, you can build the Rust package by running `cargo run` (it should run the above `hello_again_world` program). Run `cargo check` from that same directory if you would like to just do a dry run.

For more information about Cargo, check out the [corresponding documentation](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/index.html).
